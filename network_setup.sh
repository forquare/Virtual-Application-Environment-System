# THE SCRIPT NEEDS TO BE RUN AS THE ROOT USER WITH A PRIVALEGED ROLE.  
# THIS CAN BE EMULATED USING THE PFEXEC COMMAND.  THE USER ABLE TO DO THIS IS
# USUALLY DEFINED ON INSTALLTION ALONG WITH THE ROOT PASSWORD.  THIS SCRIPT 
# NEEDS ROOT PERMISSIONS TO CREATE VIRTUAL NETWORKS 
# USING `dladm` AND STARTS IPV4 FORWARDING
###############################################################################
# This script does the following:
# * Looks for current IP addresses used
# * Derives suitable free subnet to use
# * Creates virtual switch (etherstub)
# * Creates virtual NIC (VNIC) and attaches to switch
# * Sets up IPv4 forwarding in global zone (to forward traffic from VAE zones)
# * Plumbs VNIC
# * Finds default gateway
# * Adds new route to the routing table

###############################################################################
# CHANGELOG
# v1.4
#    Introduced better error checking.  Script now traps signals and cleans up 
#    after itself.
#
# v1.3
#    Added new script to bring up virtual network on reboots.  Script
#    now creates a service within SMF.
#
# v1.2
#    Changed the way script identifies used subnets.  It now uses a similar
#    maths to that of UNIX permissions, if a desired subnet isn't available
#    then a 1, 2, 4 or 8 is added to a variable, a case statement then 
#    decides what subnet to use, or if user intervention is needed.
#
# v1.1.1
#    Added variables for config file location and ECHO to point to 
#    /usr/gnu/bin/echo.
#
# v1.1
#    Removed need for pfexec.  User must now run script as root or use pfexec
#    themselves.  Because this is called from INSTALL.sh,
#    we shouldn't have to worry.
#
# v1.0
#    Functionaly completed
#
# v0.6
#    Added echo commands to print out what is happening and if it completes.
#    Also added mechanism which created a file if the script fails/aborts,
#    INSTALL.sh should check for this file and also quit.
#    Discovered the subnet finder is flawed, if values are submitted in
#    correct order, we might choose a subnet that is not actually free.
#    HOWEVER: We will keep this as it will be easier to say that script 
#    only works for machines on one subnet (multiple NICS can be used
#    but only on same subnet)
# 
# v0.5
#    Script can find IP addresses
#    Switch and VNIC creation are implemented, VNIC is plumbed with IP address
#    and ipv4-forwarding is enabled on the global zone
